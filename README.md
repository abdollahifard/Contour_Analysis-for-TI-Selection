# Training-Image-Selection-for-MPS-via-Contours-Analysis
The promising performance of multiple-point statistics methods, as efficient environmental modelling tools, highly depends on the availability of appropriate training images (TIs). When enough information is not available about the behavior of the variables, large uncertainties are associated with the TIs. We introduce an efficient method for selecting a compatible TI among a set of discrete choices, based on establishing compatibility with available conditioning data. While existing approaches to do this consider all available data-events, we concentrate on a limited number of data-events around the contours and edges of the image. The proposed method is evaluated in different sampling rates, based on hundreds of sample sets extracted from binary, categorical and continuous images, and compared with exhaustive data-event extraction. Our experiments reveal that the proposed method improves the required CPU-time by up to two orders of magnitude and at the same time leads to a slight improvement in the recognition accuracy.
